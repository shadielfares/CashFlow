## 🏗️ How We Built It 👨‍💻

Our development journey involved a mix of tried-and-true web fundamentals and cutting-edge technologies:

- **Frontend**: 
  - HTML, CSS, JS for the core structure and functionality
  - Extensive use of Three.JS for creating an *aesthetic* and immersive user experience
- **Design Philosophy**: We aimed for simplicity, efficiency, and elegance in Cash Flow's design.
- **Backend**:
  - Initially explored Django and Flask for database and API integration
  - Transitioned to a streamlined model using HTML, JavaScript, and Node.js for improved efficiency

## 🚧 Challenges We Overcame 💪

Building Cash Flow wasn't without its hurdles. Here are some challenges we faced and conquered:

1. **3D Visualization Complexity**: Correctly orienting moving vectors in Three.JS while considering the orthographic perspective was a significant challenge.
2. **Balancing Depth and Simplicity**: Striking the right balance between representing depth in our design while maintaining simplicity was a delicate task.
3. **Data Management**: Configuring data chunks to maximize the allocated upload size for AI processing required careful optimization.
4. **Backend Integration**: Initial complications with Django and Flask led us to develop a more effective model using frontend technologies.

## 🏆 Proud Achievements 🎉

While it might seem counterintuitive, we're incredibly proud of how simple Cash Flow turned out. Achieving simplicity in design and functionality is often more challenging than creating complexity, and we believe we've struck the right balance.
